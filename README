Sys::Facter

Collect information (facts) about the operating system.

This module is a wrapper over Pfacter CPAN module, which in turns mimics
behaviour of Facter Ruby tool
(http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/facter/)

The idea is to have a set of modules that detect various things about the host
operating system, but also to easily extend this set by new, possibly
user-written, modules. This is achieved through defining an API for additional
plugins.

Pfacter already does this, but it's quite troublesome to use directly in your
own scripts. Pfacter also lacks a POD documentation, so you would need to dig
through its code to write your own plugin. Sys::Facter solves both of these,
while preserving compatibility with Pfacter.
